# Subnetting Guide

## Introduction:

- Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks.

## Steps for Subnetting:

### Step 1: Understand IP Address Classes

- Know the three main IP address classes: A, B, and C.
- Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
- Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
- Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

### Step 2: Choose an IP Address to Subnet

- Select an IP address from the network you want to subnet.

### Step 3: Identify the Default Subnet Mask

- Determine the default subnet mask based on the IP address class:
  - Class A: 255.0.0.0
  - Class B: 255.255.0.0
  - Class C: 255.255.255.0

### Step 4: Determine the Number of Subnets Needed

- Decide how many subnets are required for your network design.

### Step 5: Determine the Number of Hosts Needed

- Identify the number of hosts needed per subnet.

### Step 6: Identify the Subnet Bits

- Calculate the number of subnet bits required using the formula: 2^n (where n is the number of subnet bits).

### Step 7: Determine the New Subnet Mask

- Subtract the subnet bits from the default subnet mask to find the new subnet mask.

### Step 8: Find the Subnet Address Range

- Calculate the size of each subnet and determine the range of IP addresses for each subnet.

### Step 9: Assign Subnets and Addresses

- Assign each subnet to a specific network segment and allocate IP addresses to devices within each subnet.

### Step 10: Verify Subnetting

- Double-check your subnetting calculations and ensure they meet the network requirements.

## Conclusion:

- Subnetting is a crucial skill for network administrators to optimize IP address usage and enhance network efficiency.
- Understanding the steps involved in subnetting helps in creating well-organized and scalable networks.
